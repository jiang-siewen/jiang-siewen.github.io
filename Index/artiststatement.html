	<h1>Statement</h1>

 
 <p>Growing up as a gay kid I had to face my own challenges whether it be emotional or physical. Throughout my work I touch on the nature of sexuality, and our sexual orientation or identity. As part of my own therapy in dealing with such issues, my photographs focus on my emotional experiences. It also represents the vulnerability I've felt with such partners along with the heartbreak and mental exhaustion it has caused. I needed some sort of outlet for all these emotions that I was feeling because it was eating away at my happiness and mental health.</p>

 <p>My work also focuses on my passions which include fashion and creative direction. Furthermore, it also focuses on the diversity I am surrounded with. In San Jose, which is where I currently live, I capture diversity by having people from different backgrounds pose for my pictures. I believe diversity of different cultures is beautiful and I try and do my part to incorporate that in my work.
